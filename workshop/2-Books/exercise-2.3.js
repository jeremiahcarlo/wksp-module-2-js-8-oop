// Exercise 2.3
// We need a method in our BookList to make adding books possible.
//  - create an add method to add books to the library.
//      - when you add a book, it should increase the read, or unread count.
//  - use the add method to add in a few books.
//      - you can call new Book without declaring it as variable.
//      - e.g. homeLibrary.add(new Book('The Shining', 'Horror', 'Stephen King'));

// Once you have added a few books, console.log(homeLibrary) to see if all is well.
